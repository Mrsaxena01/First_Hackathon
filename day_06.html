    <h2>First Principle: The Web is More Than Text and Images</h2>
    <p>The fundamental truth is that a webpage should be able to deliver any kind of content, not just static text and pictures. For years, this was a major problem. To play a video or audio file, browsers had to rely on third-party plugins like Adobe Flash, QuickTime, or Silverlight. This was inefficient, insecure, and inconsistent across different computers.</p>
    <br>

    <h3>The Core Problem</h3>
    <p>How can we embed video and audio into a webpage in a standardized, native, and plugin-free way? We need a universal system that works on every modern browser, from a desktop PC to a mobile phone, without requiring the user to install anything extra.</p>

    <h3>The Logical Solution: The HTML5 &lt;video&gt; and &lt;audio&gt; Tags</h3>
    <p>The solution was to create dedicated HTML tags whose sole purpose is to embed and control media.</p>

    <h3>Part 1: The Basics - Getting a Video on the Page</h3>
    <p>The star of the show is the <video> tag. At its simplest, it just needs to know the source of the video file.</p>
      <p>code Html</p>
      <p>downloadcontent_copy</p>
     <img src="images/32.png" alt=""><br>
     <p>The Problem We Immediately Face: If you put this on a page, you'll just see the first frame of the video as a static image. You can't play it, pause it, or change the volume. It's not a video player; it's just a video frame.</p>
     <p>The Solution: We need to add player controls. The browser has a beautiful set of default controls built-in, and we can turn them on with a simple attribute.</p>

     <br>
     <h3>The controls Attribute: The Magic Switch</h3>
     <p>The controls attribute is a boolean attribute. You don't need to set it to a value (controls="true" is unnecessary); its mere presence turns the feature on.</p>

     <p>Result: You now have a fully functional video player on your page, complete with a play/pause button, a timeline scrubber, volume controls, and a fullscreen option. This is the simplest, most effective way to embed a video.</p>
